<h2>What's New and Current Roadmap</h2>

<p class="date">Published on: 10 FEBRUARY, 2014</p>
<p>
    So a year has passed already and it turned out to be great for us.
    One thing that <strong>amazed</strong> us is that before starting any marketing efforts we had clients that heard of us somehow and
    remained active to this day. This is a great confirmation of our work and effort and an amazing encouragement to go on.
    <br /><br />
    We have a great roadmap planned for this year and we are determined to bring it online.
</p>

<h3>SLA product and Customer Support Portal</h3>
<p>
    This new product has been in our pipeline for a few months now and it is almost ready. The deadline for the launch is the end of March.
    Of course we keep our promise and our existing clients will get the new product for free.
    <br /><br />
    This new product will allow you to enter in a SLA agreement with your customers and it will also allow you to offer a Customer Portal
    where your products can receive feedback from your clients. Of course, you can also offer support through it. It works both ways.
    <br /><br />
</p>

<h3>Predefined Workflows</h3>
<p>
    If you are a software company, an architecture studio, a call center, a vet clinic or a construction company we want to offer you predefined workflows.
    <br /><br />
    We already work closely with an architecture studio to figure out a suitable workflow.
</p>

<h3>Git Support and Extended Import Functionality</h3>
<p>
    Git support is scheduled for release later this year. First  we will offer only a Git server with basic admin options, afterwards we will built on that.
    Depending on your feedback we will implement features that are requested.
    <br /><br />
    And, if you are a customer with an existing Bugzilla or Jira database, we will offer a streamlined import tool.
</p>

<h3>Contact Manager</h3>
<p>
    This will be a new product in our pipeline. At the moment it is a concept to be further developed.
    <br /><br />
    Our intention is to offer a small CRM where you can find people you were in contact with and related information.
</p>

<h3>Go Big</h3>
<p>
    We believe that hard work, vision and God are the keys of success. We have come this far and we're planning to go even further.
