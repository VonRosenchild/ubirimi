    We work hard to over deliver new features to our products every day.
    This is a summary of the new features added since the last release.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>a brand new free mail server. This is the default option. So for the clients that to not have a SMTP server configuration, they can use our default server.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>in <a href="https://www.ubirimi.com/product/yongo">Yongo</a> we introduced 3 new filter criteria: fix version, affected version and component</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>image attachments now have a thumbnail preview and a full gallery presentation</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>top menu bar has been greatly improved for better access to our products</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>the interface redesign using bootstrap. The apps look a lot better. We concentrated on the dialogs, tables and buttons.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Any feedback is highly appreciated since we make every effort possible to implement features on client request.</p>
