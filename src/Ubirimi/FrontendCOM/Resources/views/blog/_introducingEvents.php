<p class="date">Published on: 16 SEPTEMBER, 2013</p>

<p>
    We are glad to announce a new product joining our suite, <a href="/product/events">Events</a>
</p>

<p>
    We have built a complete calendar application to help you manage your business better. Plan events, holidays, deadlines, meetings. Now it is possible with Events.
</p>
<p>
    Import your existing Gmail, Outlook or iCalendar calendars into Events and run your business from one central place. No need anymore for 10 application on 10 domains to keep
    your projects running.<br /><br />

    Also you have the possibility to share calendars with your team members so you can stay in touch with each other.
    <br /><br />
    We have a great roadmap ahead. More features will be added in the near feature. Please send us your feedback.
    <br /><br />
    Thank you for your continued support.
    <br /><br />
    Stay tuned for more!
