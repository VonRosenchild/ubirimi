<h2>Feature Release</h2>

<p class="date">Published on: 20 JANUARY, 2013</p>
<p>
    We have great news for you: as with release 1.802 we are introducing lots of new and interesting stuff:
</p>

<h3>private/public mode</h3>
<p>
    In private mode only administrators can create new users. If you are running in public mode any user can sign up and post issues.<br /><br />
    This can turn out to be of great help for help desk operators where you receive issues from your customers. This way you manage the internal and external processes of your company.
</p>

<h3>agile swimlanes</h3>
<p>
    Group your issues for a better management. Currently we offer grouping by stories, more options in the coming releases
</p>

<h3>better and improved URLs</h3>
<p>
    All our products have gone a URL beautifying process.
</p>

<h3>extended quick search functionality</h3>
<p>
    so far you could search an issue in the current project by its number. Now you can also search by text (summary, description, comments).
</p>

<p>Don't forget you can send us feedback directly from within the application. We would love to hear from your!

<br /><br />
Happy bug hunting!
</p>
