<h2>Revamping our image</h2>

<p class="date">Published on: 12 JULY, 2013</p>
<p>
    Today we are introducing a totally new and awesome image for ourselves.
    This was much needed as we begun to grow and make a stand in front of our competition.
</p>
<p>Everything is now clean, light and beautiful. Information is much better organized, finding your way around our site has been greatly improved.</p>
<p>To make a better point of our value we let you know the strong points of our products right on the home page through an easy to read comparison table.</p>
<p>Also we have been hard at work to give a unique image to our company and to each product respectively. Nice, easy to remember logos to enchant your eyes.</p>
<p>Of course, what is a release without some new product features? In <a href="/product/yongo">Yongo</a> now it is much more easier to change the fields and screens for projects.
    Also a support link is present in the header of our products so that you can have a quick access to our support system. In <a href="/product/documentador">Documentador</a> now you can see the child pages
right above the comments section.</p>
<p>Making use of <a href="/product/documentador">Documentador</a> we have begun to create documentation pages for important sections of our products. You will begin to see a question
mark in the top right area of the page that will take you right to the documentation page specific for that area.</p>
<p>We believe that this important refresh is much a awaited one. We will continue to improve it over time. Don't forget your feedback is always appreciated.</p>
<p>Have a nice look around!</p>
