<?php
    $eventId = $_GET['id'];
?>
Would you like to delete only this event, all events in the series, or this and all future events in the series?

<table cellspacing="2px" cellpadding="2px">
    <tr>

            <input id="only_this_instance_delete_event_<?php echo $eventId ?>" type="button" style="width: 170px;" value="Only this instance" />
        </td>
        <td>
            <div>All other events in the series will remain.</div>
        </td>
    </tr>
